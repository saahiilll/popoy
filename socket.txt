socket programming in python

two machine needed server and client
* The socket module*
deb1 server
deb2 client

(we have to create a server socket)

socket method takes three parameter
socket (socket_family, socket_type, protocol=0)
the socket()method takes three arguments:
1.the social family is either
	AF_UNIX or AF_INET
2.for internet based application,it is typicall AF_INET
3.the socket type is either
	*SOCK_STREAM (for tcp)
	*SOCK_DGRAM (for udp)


///HOW TO CREATE A SOCKET
>>>dir()
>>>import socket
>>>dir()
>>>TCPSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
>>>

///BIND THE SOCKET
bind takes only one argument which is tuple in parenthesis

>>>TCPSocket.bind(("0.0.0.0", 8000))
0.0.0.0 means accept from anywhere
8000--> is a port where we have to listen

/////listen for connestions//
>>>TCPSocket.listen()
it will listen the port number 8000 after giving above command

then check it by typing ss -ant in another instance

/////////accept the connection////
>>>(ClientSocket, (ip,port)) = TCPSocket.accept()
>>>u will not get >>> 
then go the client machine and install telnet 

telnet (server ip) port(8000)

then go to server machine-->
>>>print(ip)
>>>print(port)

///if u want to send data to client machine throuch client socket///
>>>ClientSocket.send(b"\nMessage\n")
(b is for binary)
check on the client machine

///if you want to receive data from client then type//
>>>data = ClientSocket.recv(2048)
go to the client machine and type the data

now come to server
>>>print(data)

//////now if you want to close the client connection you can use following //
>>>ClientSocket.close()
///if you want to close the socket//
>>>TCPSocket.close()
